# Minimal memory OS 

This project is a minimal memory OS that can be run on a x86 machine. It is my HW for the [ASC course at the University of Bucharest](https://cs.unibuc.ro/~crusu/asc/index.html).
The link to the HW is [here](https://cs.unibuc.ro/~crusu/asc/Arhitectura%20Sistemelor%20de%20Calcul%20(ASC)%20-%20Tema%20Laborator%202024.pdf).
